 - This app backend was build using principles of CRUD of data in JSON format, OOP and Clean Code.
 - The design was entirely made on Figma and exported to work with Tkinter.
 - It was first done in my native language (Brazilian Portuguese), but after I created this repository, I've updated the code and interface to English.
 - My next step is to add a functionality to send the list via WhatsApp.
 - Any suggestions are welcome!
